# 👋 Hello!

# 🚀 About Me

I’m an Artificial Intelligence engineering student at **ENIB** (École Nationale d'Ingénieurs de Brest), passionate about **signal processing**, **computer vision**, and building **intelligent systems**.

In my free time, I design and develop projects in various fields that interest me (AI, Data Science, software Engineering,...)

For example I have created  **a fatigue detector (FatiguEye)** and **AI powered application that recognizes emotions in the human speech (EmotionAI-Voice)**. I am currently developping **an AI local assistant (Numa)** and **a reverse engineering AI tool for Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) (BoardMapper) with Florian Pasco**.

On my GitHub you will find various projects using various technologies, probably mostly **Data Science and Machine Learning** but not only , as I am curious by nature and **always looking forward to learning new technologies and acquiring new skills**.

# 📚 Highlighted Projects

- **Numa**  
  A fully local intelligent voice assistant combining speech recognition, open-source LLM, and expressive speech synthesis — all without cloud dependencies.

- **FatiguEye**  
  A fatigue detection app using computer vision to track eye blinks and micro-sleep indicators via webcam (EAR-based analysis).

- **EmotionAI-Voice**  
  A tool that detects emotions (stress, calm, anger...) from voice recordings using deep learning and a user-friendly interface.
